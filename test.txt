Core Mechanics
Player Ship

The player will directly move their ship up, down, left, and right (inthe XY plane) using the WASD or arrow keys 
PlayerShip maximum speed will be 10m/s, and the ship should tilt slightly in the direction of motion.
The PlayerShip is composed of two models: the ship body and the turret.  
The PlayerShip begins with three Jumps. When the PlayerShip collides with an Asteroid, it will
destroy the Asteroid and jump/teleport the PlayerShip to a safer location (consuming 1 Jump in the
process).

Firing
The PlayerShip will fire a bullet every time the player clicks the left mouse button . The turret will constantly rotate to track the (visible) mouse pointer . Bullets will
move at a speed of 20m/s and will be spherical  . After two seconds, Bullets will destroy
themselves. Bullets will also be destroyed if they collide with an Asteroid.

Asteroids
 When an Asteroid is spawned, it is generated at a random rotation with a random velocity  .
There is 2 types of Asteroid :
- Asteriods that give the player points (blue color ) 
- Asteriods that give the player a power up  ( invincibilty for a limited time / red color  ) 



When an Asteroid collides with a Bullet, both the Bullet and Asteroid are destroyed, and the Player
gains points 


Level Completion and Game Over
The level is completed when all Asteroids have been destroyed. The game is over when the
PlayerShip hits an Asteroid but has zero Jumps remaining.


Game Features
Interstitial Screens
The game should have Main Menu, Level Load, and a Game Over screens. The Level Load and
Game Over screens should have simple animation of the text boxes.



Design pattern :
it's recommended to use object pooling for the asteriods and singletons for the managers .
